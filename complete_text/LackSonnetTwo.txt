Lack-Sonnet Two.

Her eyes are green, serene, a dream, a screen,
that filters black, for lack of better words,
to say with light what I have never heard,
and make it clean, and seen, a dream—redeem.

My eyes shut.
The dark.
The dream.
The nightmare.

That surreal scene, the dawn before sunrise,
when we watched Venus, and looked in her eyes—
and they were not there, not there, not anywhere.

We saw Aurora, with bats in her hair;
we watched as the black fled Dawn’s coming light.

It crept, and it bled, and vanished from sight.

Rising, the sun
found us too sad to care.

We three cried our eyes out, they fell on the ground.
Guessing whose are whose, we passed them around.
