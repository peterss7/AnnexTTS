Lack-Sonnet Five.

Distance.
And the cancer
cans her answer.

Silence,
as her Master
holds her faster.

Darkness.
And the deathless
will outlast her.

Symbols.
Stillness.
And the broken dancer.

Flightless feathers
of the dying sparrow.
Broken wings
upon the ground.
Closing eyes.

See the sun,
once more soaring
in the skies.

Hallucinating blue above,
and green below.

And again.
Underwater.
Lying still.

A fish
that swam through all
the ocean’s deep.
That can now only wait
for endless sleep.
Yet wants to see
more corals.
Never will.

Impossibility
to understand.

Pathetically standing
with poems in hand.
