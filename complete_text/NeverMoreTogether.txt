Where as once
We saw the sea:
As she will be:
As ash:
As will my Ashley.

Undressed beneath the sunny bees.

Now long ago:
What songs of sorrow.
do I know?
What could walk on wicked water?
And see more than sin? and slaughter?:

I am mastered by these matters:
Of whither went the bow?:

That arched across
A blue white sky.
That I no longer know.

Of whence there comes a cancer.

Questions I know longer ask.

Yet.
necromancers
Answer.
