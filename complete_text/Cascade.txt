Cascade.

This is the place we chose
for the UFOs to land tonight.

And a cold, warm, eclectic wind
of invisible space washes over me.
And for a moment, I walk
on the surface of a planet
without a surface,
and I am a god.

But the feeling did last—
it did not last long.
Not enough for me
to fully finish feeling
the feeling that felt so fully fluid.

And rivered me into a soul of water,
that dried up into a sea of ashes,
that fell from the sky
as the volcanic dust of Saint Helen.

Who could not save the city of Troy
from the beauty of her radiant hair
that burned the skin of millions of innocents,
as the bombs fell on Japan.

While nations were burning
by the anger of a people
who were betrayed
by a world that was dead.
