Lack-Sonnet One.

If black is bright.
Like Sol in the midnight.

If day’s without white,
and nothing is seen.

If grace is the reason
rot must be clean.

If lack, not black,
always siphons the light.

If never so dark
as holes beyond sight.

If defined is space,
though bereft of place.

If blessed is life
that deserves disgrace.

If black and white
can harmonize right.

Then where once grew the tree
that could teach us?

Then what do the words
that mean nothing say?

Then when did we feel
what cannot reach us?

Then whence came the twilight,
the dawn, and day?

It spirals out.
Endless. Infinite.

And comes back down
just for the fun of it.
