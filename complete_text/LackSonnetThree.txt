Lack-Sonnet III

The stinging singing, a single signal,
A motionless soundwave hangs in this place,
Infesting the air and haunting the space,
The searing hearing, when nothings mingle.

The let go echo again returning.
The bangs of the banging, began long ago.
Seeming like meaning, that we cannot know.
Silence inside us, airborne and screaming.

The hoarding, recording, and reordering,
The recursive writing nothing in cursive,
Scratching a missive that feels dismissive.
Delusion, illusion, and meandering.

You've just filled pages with invisible ink.
The thoughts and feelings and the broken link.
