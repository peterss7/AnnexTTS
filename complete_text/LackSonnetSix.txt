Lack-Sonnet Six.

Out with my telescope,
looking for hope.

I see a white dot.
Nothing’s stupider.

Zoom in.
Red spot.
It must be Jupiter.

Love for astronomy,
attempting to cope.

Up next on the list,
I look for Saturn.
It is a planet with rings.

Next up: Mars.
A planet of red.
Not war’s cosmic scars.

Mercury’s cursory.
You see the pattern?

Listen closely
to the celestial choir.

Pluto demoted.
Neptune has the blues.

Can Uranus
maybe offer us clues?

Is beauty a thing
the gods don’t require?

If it’s consolation,
there is still Venus.

You won’t believe
the size of her penis.
