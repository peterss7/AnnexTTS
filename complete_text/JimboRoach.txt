Jimbo Roach.

He wanted to live gracefully,
happily, productively, efficiently—
aesthetically, pleasingly, willingly.

But hidden Maybe-god bystanding,
wanted instead a life of praying,
devoting, inventing higher power.

Monuments built. A sacred clock tower.
And maggots—unsated, hungry, putrid.
Disgusting as the rot they rid.

And cockroaches. Centipedes.
Everything our bodies feed.

Hither and thither shifted the logic.
Fabled, unstable, ever more chronic.

The meaning quelled, Jimbo Roach sought,
and all the reason and thought he brought.
of Enlightenment, into the herds.

Somewhere behind his mind rang the words,
forming themselves into a song—
the clicking of roaches, wrong.

Beneath the muddy rock. Outside.
Multiplicity. The centipede’s stride.

Then the Not joined in. Lack-light waxing.
FORD F-one fifties eclipsing.

A sky of green where shar la main grew,
upon his war giraffe, and resolute drew
Holy Itinerary
on the Beach of Bones.

Roach wives three.
The eggs hatch.
The Larva Machine.

Dead bones. Ice cream cones. Clean.
The funeral roaches— a laughing choir.
Disgraced in state, and burned in fire:

But Jimbo wanted to be a roach.
