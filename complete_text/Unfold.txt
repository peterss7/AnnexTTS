To See it All Unfold.

I plucked the string again.
To see it all unfold.

Please don’t be mad, my friend.
When it’s time,
I’ll be alright again.

And watch it all unfold.

After this endless moment,
and it all unfolds,
I’ll never know more about it.

To see it all unfold.
Again untwined.

To see it all again unfold.
It’s all my fate.
Again untwined.

Can’t be helped again.

To see it all unfold.
