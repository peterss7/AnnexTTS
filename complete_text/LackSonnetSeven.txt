Lack-Sonnet Seven.

Whereas once we wondered
whether Wendy
would walrus water
our wittle assessess—

and witness the witless
beaten shitlessness
of shirtless centipedes.
Very trendy.

And wind wander
wheresoever we would wish.
Whither weathers wilder wonders
whiles wet.

Wooden logs.
Saw saws.
And power outlet.

So the earth-bound narwhal
may ever eat fish.

Now long ago,
nobody knows
when all the wars were won.

Nobody now remembers
when we labeled armaments
“return to sender,”

and could explain
whatever may befall.

Ev’rybody knows:
when it sounds silly,

then whoever likes it
is a silly Billy.
