Invisible Poetix
Lack-Sonnet I

If black is bright like Sol in the midnight,
If day’s without white, and nothing is seen,
If grace is the reason rot must be clean,
If lack not black always siphons the light,

If never so dark as holes beyond sight,
If defined is space though bereft of place,
If blessed is life that deserves disgrace,
If black and white can harmonize right,

Then where once grew the tree that could teach us?
Then what do the words that mean nothing say?
Then when did we feel what cannot reach us?
Then whence came the twilight, the dawn, and day?

It spirals out, endless and infinite,
And comes back down just for the fun of it.

Lack-Sonnet II

Her eyes are green, serene, a dream, a screen,
That filters black, for lack of better words,
To say with light what I have never heard,
And make it clean, and seen, a dream — redeem!

My eyes shut. The dark. The dream. The nightmare,
That surreal scene, the dawn before sunrise —
When we watched Venus, and looked in her eyes —
And they were not there, not there, not anywhere.

We saw Aurora with bats in her hair;
We watched as the black, fled Dawn's coming light.
It crept, and it bled, and vanished from sight.
Rising, the sun found us too sad to care.

We three cried our eyes out, they fell on the ground.
Guessing whose are whose, we passed them around.
Lack-Sonnet III

The stinging singing, a single signal,
A motionless soundwave hangs in this place,
Infesting the air and haunting the space,
The searing hearing, when nothings mingle.

The let go echo again returning.
The bangs of the banging, began long ago.
Seeming like meaning, that we cannot know.
Silence inside us, airborne and screaming.

The hoarding, recording, and reordering,
The recursive writing nothing in cursive,
Scratching a missive that feels dismissive.
Delusion, illusion, and meandering.

You've just filled pages with invisible ink.
The thoughts and feelings and the broken link.

Lack-Sonnet IV

A liar, the wiring, by spiraling
Out beyond nowhere, where connections spare
The need to have anchored what's never there,
Nothing to nonsense, endless and piling,

A mundane background then sources the panic.
Blurring and swirling inside the white noise,
The shapes, the colors, in order, destroys.
Static is thusly reformed by the manic.

Unseeing the meaning we web everywhere,
Unbinding the winding twine woven in wind,
Unfolding the holding hands hiding sin,
Resigning the rhyming that gods will not share.

Revealing the feeling by peeling the —
Hearing the dancer the answer sing: the —

Lack-Sonnet V

Distance and the cancer cans her answer.
Silence as her Master holds her faster.
Darkness and the deathless will outlast her.
Symbols, stillness, and the broken dancer.

Flightless feathers of the dying sparrow,
Broken wings upon the ground, closing eyes,
See the sun, once more soaring in the skies,
Hallucinating blue above and green below.

And again, underwater, lying still,
A fish that swam through all the ocean’s deep
That can now only wait for endless sleep,
Yet wants to see more corals, never will.

Impossibility to understand,
Pathetically standing with poems in hand.

Lack-Sonnet VI

Out with my telescope, looking for hope.
I see a white dot, nothing's stupider.
Zoom in: red spot. It must be Jupiter.
Love for astronomy, attempting to cope.

Up next on the list, I look for Saturn.
It is a planet with rings. Next up: Mars.
A planet of red, not war's cosmic scars.
Mercury's cursory. You see the pattern?

Listen closely to the celestial choir.
Pluto demoted, Neptune has the blues.
Can Uranus maybe offer us clues?
Is beauty a thing the gods don't require?

If it's consolation, there is still Venus.
You won't believe the size of her penis.
Lack-Sonnet VII

Whereas once we wondered whether Wendy
Would walrus water our wittle assessess —
— and witness the witless beaten shitlessness
Of shirtless centipedes (very trendy) —

And wind wander wheresoever we would wish,
Whither weathers wilder wonders whiles wet
Wooden logs saw saws and power outlet —
So the earth bound narwhal may ever eat fish —

Now long ago, nobody knows when all
The wars were won. Nobody now remembers
When we labeled armaments “return to sender,”
And could explain whatever may befall.

Ev’rybody knows that when it sounds silly,
Then whoever likes it is a silly Billy.


Cascade

This is the place we chose,
For the UFOs to land tonight.

And a cold, warm, eclectic wind
Of invisible space washes over me,
And for a moment I walk
On the surface of a planet
Without a surface,
And I am a god.

But the feeling did last —
It did not last long.
Not enough for me
To fully finish feeling
The feeling that felt so fully fluid,

And rivered me into a soul of water,
That dried up into a sea of ashes,
That fell from the sky
As the volcanic dust of Saint Helen,
Who could not save the city of Troy
From the beauty of her radiant hair
That burned the skin of millions of innocents
As the bombs fell on Japan
While nations were burning by the anger of a people
Who were betrayed by a world that was dead.


Never More Together

Whereas once, we saw the sea —
As she will be, as ash,
As will my Ashley,
Undressed beneath the sunny bees —

Now long ago,
What songs of sorrow do I know?
What could walk on wicked water
And see more than sin and slaughter?

I am mastered by these matters:
Of whither went the bow,
That arched across a blue-white sky
That I no longer know;
Of whence there comes a cancer.

Questions I no longer ask —
Yet necromancers answer.
Alone Alone

Alone, it only feels you, without you —
With you, it only feels you, alone.
The Prodigal Fly

I am a fly,
But I am not flying.
I am the fly that returns.
The prodigal fly.

Azazel

Azazel was a demonaire
Infested in the anti-air
Who lit a light of darkness
Held in multi-hell
And watched us there.
Bismarck's Lament

Planet old.
Rock big was.
Was broke.
Broke more.
Brokens breaking.
All Busted.
Never more together.
To See it All Unfold

I plucked the string again,
To see it all unfold.
Please don’t be mad my friend.
When it’s time I’ll be alright again.
And watch it all unfold.
After this endless moment and it all unfolds,
I’ll never know more about it.
To see it all unfold,
Again untwined.
To see it all again unfold.
It’s all my fate, again untwined.
Can’t be helped again.
To see it all unfold.

Punctuate

How now,
Sham wow?
See god.
See how.
We punctuate existence.
Toilet

Reptilian plumbing arts,
It's where the quality starts.
Toilets of snake skin,
A symbol that says win
When your boss comes over and farts.
Walrus Water

Nobody remembers when the wars were won,
When we wondered whether Wendy
Would walrus water our wittle assesseses —
And witness
The witless
Beat shitless
By shirtless
Centipedes.
I Have an Idea

I have an idea.
It's something good,
But just an idea.

I can't know
If it will ever be.
If it never is,
What else won't I see?

I have a good idea —
But I am the idea.

I was the sound
Of a sunny day.
It was to go to me,
But I am not to be.
Centipedes

I see flitting through the eaves
The shapes of running centipedes,
That chase abandoned mansion trees,
Whose open windows catch a breeze,
That Autumn uses to get leaves.
Office Supplies

Smoked by Gumby,
Cotton candy salesman,
Addicted to elephant meth,
Bound by employees,
Feeding screwdriver eyes —
The Necrommaculate Office Supplies.

They just burned all the doves,
The aroma he loves,
Berserker pheromone,

Jimbo Roach

He wanted to live gracefully,
Happily, productively, and efficiently —
Aesthetically, pleasingly, willingly.
But hidden Maybe-god bystanding,
Wanted instead a life of praying,
Devoting, inventing higher power,
Monuments built, a sacred clock tower,
And maggots unsated, hungry, putrid,
Disgusting as the rot they rid,
And cockroaches, centipedes,
Everything our bodies feed.

Hither and thither shifted the logic.
Fabled, unstable, ever more chronic
The meaning quelled, Jimbo Roach sought,
And all the reason and thought he brought
Of Enlightenment into the herds.
Somewhere behind his mind rang the words,
Forming themselves into a song,
The clicking of roaches wrong,
Beneath the muddy rock, outside,
Multiplicity, the centipede’s stride.

Then the Not joined in, Lack-light waxing,
FORD F-150s Eclipsing
A sky of green where Charlemagne grew
Upon his war giraffe and resolute drew
Holy Itinerary
On the Beach of Bones. Roach wives three,
The eggs hatch. The Larva Machine
Dead bones, ice cream cones, clean.
The funeral roaches a laughing choir.
Disgraced in state and burned in fire.

But Jimbo wanted to be a roach.
